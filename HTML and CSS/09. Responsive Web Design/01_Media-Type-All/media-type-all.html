        <span>This is not red because it appears before any paragraph.</span>
        <p>Here is a paragraph.</p>
        <code>Here is some code.</code>
        <span>
            This span is red because it appears after the paragraph, even though there
            are other nodes in between
        </span>
        <p>Whatever it may be, keep smiling.</p>
        <h1>Dream big</h1>
        <span>
            Doesn't matter how many or what kind of nodes are in between, all spans from
            the same parent after a paragraph are red.
        </span>
    </article>
    <span>
        This span is not red because it doesn't share a parent with a paragraph
