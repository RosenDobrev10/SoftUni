Our Mission

Animals
We fight for ALL animals, from A to Z.

How we work
Ending the cruelest practice
We are focused on ending the worst forms of institutionalized animal suffering. Our progress is the result of our work with governments, the private sector and multinational bodies; public awareness and consumer education campaigns, public policy efforts and more.

Caring for animals in crisis
We respond to large-scale cruelty cases and disasters around the world, providing rescue, hands-on care, logistics and expertise when animals are caught in crises. Our care centers heal and provide lifelong sanctuary to abused, abandoned, exploited, vulnerable and neglected animals.

Building a stronger animal protection movement
Through partnerships, trainings, support, collaboration and more, we're building a more humane world by empowering and expanding the capacity of animal welfare advocates and organizations in the United States and across the globe. Together, we'll bring about faster change for animals.
