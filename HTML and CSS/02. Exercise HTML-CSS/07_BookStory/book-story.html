        <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
        <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
        <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of
           <em>Nature, New Scientist</em>, and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed
            copy of <em>On The Road</em>. It had been Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she spent in these
            four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.
        </p>
        <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming
            that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>.</p>
