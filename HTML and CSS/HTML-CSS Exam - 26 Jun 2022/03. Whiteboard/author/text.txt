Have questions?
Why did you create HustleCase?
When you want to capture a quick sketch, we recommend using an app called Microsoft Office Lens that has a whiteboard setting to capture photos.
Is it only for Macs?
The hard shell cases are only for Macs at the moment. We are working on adding more laptops types soon.
How durable is the case?
The cases are made of plastic, making it durable enough to protect your laptop from bumps and scratches, but light and breathable enough to release heat.
Is it hard to erase?
Our dry-erase surface has been designed to be scratch resistant, easy to write on and even easier to wipe.
Where do you currently ship to?
We ship worldwide! Due to high demands, each case will take 1-2 weeks to process and be shipped.
How do I record my sketches?
As freelance designers, we found our office being wherever our laptop was. We wanted an accesible whiteboard to save time and paper and created the HustleCase!
