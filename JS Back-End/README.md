# ðŸ’» JS Back-End 

The course is intensive and aims to familiarize students with developing server-side JavaScript applications on the Node.js platform using Express.js as a framework. During the course we will learn how to create a server with Node.js, learn the server-client architecture and how to make easy and fast data-driven web applications with Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB using modern techniques and tools. One of the most popular non-relational databases, MongoDB, will be covered along with the Mongoose library for taking data from it. Towards the end of the course, a complete REST API will be built from scratch using Express.js and MongoDB. There's a lot of emphasis on hands-on exercises that get you involved in real-world projects to build web pages, implement snippets of sites, and create complete modern websites with good design, modern structure, and mobile support.
